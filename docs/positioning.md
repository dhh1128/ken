# Positioning

Intent's sweet spot:

* Lots of code
* Lots of coders
* High scale
* High performance
* High quality bar
* Long code lifetime
* Complex engineering teams

Need quick, dirty, and throwaway?
>Try bash or php or perl.

Need simple, clean, and complete?
>Try python or ruby.

Need UI?
>Try Swift, HTML5, QT, etc.

Need hardcore? Are you building air traffic control, an embedded robotics OS, distributed supercomputers, nuclear power plant regulators, cooperative routing and realtime collision avoidance for a city worth of cars, or a lunar spaceport?

>Try Intent! ([instead of](other-approaches.md) Kotlin, Rust, Java, Go, C++, Scala, Erlang, D, Ada, Eiffel...)
