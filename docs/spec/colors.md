# Colors

Unlike regular markdown, ken allows document authors to use colors in various places (e.g., with [highlights](highlights.md) and in [tables](tables.md)). 

Colors are specified in one of five forms:

1. Using [any of the 140 color names recognized by modern browsers](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp). These names are not case-sensitive. Example: `red`, `cornflowerblue`
2. By [6-char RGB hex](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_colors_rgb.asp), without the `#` prefix. Example: `ff7f50` (Coral)
3. By 3-char RGB triple, without the `#` prefix. Example: `808` (Purple)
